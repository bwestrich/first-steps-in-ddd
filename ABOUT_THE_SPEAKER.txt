A highly enthusiastic, self-starting and responsible Tech Principal for Thoughtworks, Andrew specialises in Java / JVM technologies, agile delivery, build tools and automation, and domain driven design. Experienced across the software development lifecycle and in many sectors including government, banking, and eCommerce; what motivates him is the efficient delivery of large-scale software solutions, fulfilling complex user needs. He understands that people, architecture, process and tooling all have key roles to play in achieving this. Andrew has a passion for open source software and its communities. He has been involved with OSS to a greater or lesser extent since his career began; as a user, contributor, expert group member, or paid advocate - most famously as one of the Jenkins Job-DSL originators. Andrew enjoys sharing his experience as much as possible. This sharing is not only seen in his formal consulting engagements, but also informally through mentoring, blog posts, conferences (speaking and organising), and open-sourcing his code.
